# Churn Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using various factors such as tenure, add-on services, and month-to-month churn. The dataset includes customer behaviors, service usage, and contract details to identify key patterns leading to churn.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer details such as:
- **Customer tenure** (Months of subscription)
- **Add-on services** (Online security, tech support, streaming services)
- **Month-to-month churn**
- **Customer ID counts** to measure churn frequency

## Results & Insights
### 1. Churn by Tenure
- Customers with a tenure of **1 month have the highest churn rate**, indicating dissatisfaction early in the subscription.
- High churn spikes at **66 months (13 customers) and 70 months (11 customers)** suggest possible dissatisfaction after long-term usage.
- Implementing customer engagement strategies at the **60+ month mark** could improve retention.

### 2. Churn by Add-On Services
- Customers **without internet security, tech support, or streaming services** have the highest churn.
- Customers **with all add-on services** churn less frequently, showing the importance of bundled offerings.
- Encouraging customers to **opt for security and tech support services** can enhance retention.

### 3. Month-to-Month Churn
- A **significant drop in churn after the first few months** suggests that retaining customers early can improve long-term retention.
- Customers in the **first 6 months are most likely to leave**, requiring better onboarding and engagement strategies.
- Offering incentives like discounts or personalized engagement in the **first few months** can help reduce churn.

## Recommendations
- **Improve Early Engagement:** Customers in their first few months need better onboarding, customer support, and incentives to stay.
- **Introduce Loyalty Programs:** Long-term customers may require loyalty benefits to continue using services after 60+ months.
- **Bundle Add-On Services:** Promoting add-ons such as tech support and security can reduce churn.
